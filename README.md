### *From [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-python-web-apps-flask/tracks/flask-advanced-functionality/modules/flask-accounts-authentication/projects/flask-accounts-authentication)*


In this project you will create an application that gives visitors the ability to create accounts and authenticate in order to post about and view locations of travel and descriptions about them.



The third party modules weâ€™ll use are:

- Flask SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Login
- Flask-WTF
